## CogData

CogData is a large–scale and possibly the most challenging driving dataset publically available. It offers most diversely labeled images for vision-based driving scene understanding. It contains more than 700 one-minute video sequences of real-world winter weather driving. It contains various challenging road conditions including snow-covered roads and freezing rain. The data was both collected during day and nighttime. Over 42000 key-frames (sampled from original videos at 1fps) are synchronized with parallel sensor logs from iPhone and the car’s information such as steering angle and throttle input. Also, static road attributes are queried from OpenStreetMap and associated to images based on image-to-map location proximity (I2MAP). Consequently, each image is tagged with static and dynamic affordances such as GPS location, speed, True Heading, Course heading, vehicle drift, gyro and accelerometer info, visibility, stopping event, road condition index, vehicle steering angle and throttle input, presence of intersection, distance to intersection, road type, number of lanes, presence of bus stop, stop sign, traffic signal, giveway, road crossing, and intersection type (eg: 3-arm or 4-arm intersection). The data was collected in Kitchener-Waterloo area covering over 1000 KM of highway and residential roads.
